# Timsort
## How to use it?
###### The simpliest function to sort is:
timsort(arr)  arr - your's array
###### If you want to sort many arrays, please use:
model = prime_fast()
- fast_timsort(arr, model)
- fast_timsort(arr2, model) - if you want to sort more arrays
###### Second must be much faster for more than 1 array
## Libraries
###### Please, use tensorflow v2.0.0, Keras last version
